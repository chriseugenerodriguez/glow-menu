This plugin provides a configuration to display shipping methods as Radio button or select box on the checkout page. 

== Description ==

WooCommerce Shipping Display Mode plugin provides you an interface in WooCommerce setting section from admin side. As you know WooCommerce has removed choose shipping display mode option from 2.5.1 version. So, this plugin provides these features, admin can choose shipping display mode like radio option or select option for shipping display mode.

This Plugin is useful when you are using 4.0 or higher  version of WooCommerce and you have to use more than 20 or 30 or more then that Shipping Method at that time you do not have forced to display all shipping method only using radio button, but you have also chosen a select option for display shipping mode and by choosing select option shipping method is displayed in the drop down box so you can avoid lengthy listing of shipping method.

We have added "Select shipping mode" option for default shipping method.
